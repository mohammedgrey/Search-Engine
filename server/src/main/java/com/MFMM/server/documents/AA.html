         <p>The Tokyo Ghoul anime series has stirred quite a bit of controversy among anime and manga fans around the world. Many of them agree that the original manga on which the series is based on its much better than the TV adaptation.</p> 
         <p>Mainly because the entire dark manga series written by Sui Ishida and loved by millions have been made into just 12 episodes. This means that there is no in-depth exploration of the characters which anime fans expect.</p> 
         <p>Even so, Tokyo Ghoul is a superb dark anime series which is quite gory, especially if you choose to watch the uncensored version.</p> 
         <p>It is about a serious college student Ken Kaneki who befriends another avid reader called Rize Kamishiro and as a result, gets pulled into the dark depths of the inhuman world of the ghouls. The ghouls are scary creatures that eat human flesh. During an attack on him by the ghouls, Kaneki is almost killed. He manages to survive, but he turns into half a human and half a ghoul. This causes him to change and adapt to this new lifestyle so that he is integrated into both societies.</p> 
         <p>The series is set in Tokyo which has become a city full of evil bloodthirsty ghouls who can transform themselves to look normal and so to blend in with the humans thus finding more victims.</p> 
         <p>The 12 episodes of the anime series were aired in 2014. They were followed up with a feature film and a sequel named Tokyo Ghoul √A, and later continued with the spin-offs Tokyo Ghoul: “Jack” and Tokyo Ghoul: “Pinto.”</p> 
         <p>There is a video game for Android smartphones called Tokyo Ghoul and a video game for PlayStation Vita inspired by the popular manga and anime series.</p> 
         <p>If you like dark and gory anime, you will love Tokyo Ghoul. If you don’t fancy bloody and gory scenes, you can safely watch the censored version!</p>

            <p>Great list! My 13 years old cousin is crazy about anime, and this article gives me a great idea of what I can surprise her with for her upcoming birthday! I will definitely send her the article to read. Maybe she could find some new anime series to watch. Amazing job, guys!</p> <span class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-634" data-commentid="634" data-postid="3005" data-belowelement="div-comment-634" data-respondelement="respond" data-replyto="Reply to Brithany J." aria-label="Reply to Brithany J.">Reply</a></span>
